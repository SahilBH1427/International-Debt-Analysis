#Analyze International Debt Statistics
Project Description
 This project analyzes international debt data collected by The World Bank from 1970 to 2015. The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across various categories. The aim is to explore debt trends across different countries and indicators, focusing on key questions like:

-Total amount of debt owed by the countries.
-Country with the highest debt.
-Average amount of debt across debt indicators.
-Highest principal repayments.
-This analysis will provide insights into debt levels worldwide and trends among developing countries.

#Dataset
The dataset used in this project is available from The World Bank:

#Technologies Used
-SQL for querying and analyzing data.
-Tableau for data visualization and creating interactive dashboards.
-Power BI for additional visualizations and reporting (optional).
-Python (optional, depending on the approach) for data manipulation and analysis.

Project Tasks
-The World Bank's international debt data: The dataset contains information about international debt statistics, including debt indicators and debt amounts.
-Finding the number of distinct countries: Analyze how many unique countries are present in the dataset.
-Finding out the distinct debt indicators: Explore the different debt indicators recorded by the World Bank.
-Totaling the amount of debt owed by countries: Sum up the total debt for each country.
-Country with the highest debt: Identify which country has the maximum debt and the total debt amount.
-Average amount of debt across indicators: Calculate the average debt per indicator.
-The highest amount of principal repayments: Find out which country or region has made the highest principal repayments.
-The most common debt indicator: Identify the most frequently occurring debt indicator.
-Other viable debt issues and conclusion: Provide further analysis and insights.


#Results and Visualizations
#Key findings include:
-Total Debt: A summary of the total debt owed by developing countries.
-Country with Highest Debt: The country that owes the most debt and the exact amount.
-Average Debt per Indicator: An average amount of debt across different debt categories.
-Highest Principal Repayments: Insights into principal repayments by different countries.
